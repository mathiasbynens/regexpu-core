// From <http://unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/CaseFolding.txt>:
//
// The status field is:
// C: common case folding, common mappings shared by both simple and full
//    mappings.
// F: full case folding, mappings that cause strings to grow in length. Multiple
//    characters are separated by spaces.
// S: simple case folding, mappings to single characters where different from F.
// T: special case for uppercase I and dotted uppercase I
//    - For non-Turkic languages, this mapping is normally not used.
//    - For Turkic languages (tr, az), this mapping can be used instead of the
//      normal mapping for these characters. Note that the Turkic mappings do
//      not maintain canonical equivalence without additional processing.
//      See the discussions of case mapping in the Unicode Standard for more
//      information.
//
// Usage:
//  A. To do a simple case folding, use the mappings with status C + S.
//  B. To do a full case folding, use the mappings with status C + F.

// In case-insignificant matches when Unicode is `true` (i.e. when the `u`
// flag is enabled), all characters are implicitly case-folded using the
// simple mapping provided by the Unicode standard immediately before they
// are compared. The simple mapping always maps to a single code point, so it
// does not map, for example, `ß` (U+00DF) to `SS`. It may however map a code
// point outside the Basic Latin range to a character within, for example, `ſ`
// (U+017F) to `s`. Such characters are not mapped if Unicode is `false`.
// This prevents Unicode code points such as U+017F and U+212A from matching
// regular expressions such as `/[a‑z]/i`, but they will match `/[a‑z]/ui`.

	// folds to U+017F or U+212A directly. Since we’re only transpiling regular
